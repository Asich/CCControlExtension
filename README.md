CCControl
=================
CCControl is a convenient class for cocos2d-for-iphone which is inspired by the UIControl API class from the UIKit library of CocoaTouch. It provides a base class for control CCSprites such as CCButton or CCSlider that convey user intent to the application.

The goal of CCControl is to define an interface and base implementation for preparing action messages and initially dispatching them to their targets when certain events occur.

To use the CCControl you have to subclass it.
