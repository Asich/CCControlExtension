Cocos2d - CCControl-Examples
=================
These examples show how to the CCControl can be used.

For the moment there is only one example which is the CCControlSlider.
CCControlSlider originally comes from the cocos2d-iphone-extensions CCSlider and I've modified it to use the CCControl. For more information you can see this article: http://yannickloriot.com/2011/08/use-cccontrol-to-create-a-slider-with-cocos2d-for-iphone/

Example to use
===================== 

```
    git clone git@github.com:YannickL/CCControl-Examples.git
    cd CCControl-Examples

    # to get latest stable source from master branch, use this command:
