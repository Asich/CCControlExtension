Cocos2d - CCControl-Examples
=================
These examples show how to the CCControl can be used.

CCControls available:
 * CCControlButton:
CCControlButton provides a convenient way to create buttons with Cocos2d.

 * CCControlSlider:
CCControlSlider originally comes from the cocos2d-iphone-extensions CCSlider and I've modified it to use the CCControl. For more information you can see this article: http://yannickloriot.com/2011/08/use-cccontrol-to-create-a-slider-with-cocos2d-for-iphone/
